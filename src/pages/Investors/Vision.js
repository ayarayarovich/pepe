                    Everything we do, we believe in one thing that any project in the industry must understand - we all provide the experience. And the fundamentals of it for us is an <b>Amazement</b>. That’s an emotion laying in the very basis of every related to Adanede person. It is what we desperately seek. It is what we cannot satisfy but the need is bottomless and permanent
                    <br></br>
                    What is amazement? It is not a surprise from fortune cookie. No, it goes far beyond simple feelings: it is innovations, new records, overcame expectations, miracles, mysteries - all those things, that make a life of humankind vivid, that makes you feel alive once again, are all based on amazement. In Adanede every new endeavor or creation is unexpected, fueled by the desire to inspire amazement in those who experience it
                    <br></br><br></br>

                    Adanede is about a unique attitude. We hold the highest demands to ourselves every step of the way. Every time a new project or even a single image is created - everything is thought through and controlled literally down to every pixel. If we did something - we mean it
                    <br></br>Adanede is independent - that is why there is not and won’t be any outside investment funding. NFT is the perfect instrument to remain free and make an impact. There won’t be any corporate entities taking a large share - all stands in Adanede
                    <br></br>With growth we will explore new fields, gather new believers from every spaces. We want our activity to be a challenge, we want to live to overcome
                    <br></br>We want to create something that can become a meaningful part of your life - whether it's a personal value or a desired possession for others
